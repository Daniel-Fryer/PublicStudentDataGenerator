# PublicStudentDataGenerator

This repo provides full synthetic data generation code with percentage chances based on rough averages for UK schools, with ranges designed to cover both inner city and rural schools. This is designed as a start point, to allow researchers to work on similar data. we aim to create a concrete dataset in future work. Any number of datasets can be generated by adjusting the numToCreate parameter, datasets with only one gender, aimed at single gender schools can be created by adjusting the genderType parameter and finally, the number of students in the cohort can be adjusted via the the numStudents parameter. It should be noted that the number of classes is dependant on the number of students. A typical UK class size is of around 30-32 students, for private schools this may be closer to 20.

The code provides two csv files, one containing the generated student data and a second containing pair lists for good and bad pairs. 

It should be noted that the percentage chances used within the code for various aspects are based on UK data for secondary schools. While these ranges can be adjusted it is recommended to stick to the given ranges for generated datasets so that fair comparison between similarly structured datasets can occur.
